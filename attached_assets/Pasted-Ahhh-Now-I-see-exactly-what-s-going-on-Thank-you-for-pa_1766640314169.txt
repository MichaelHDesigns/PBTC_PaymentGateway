Ahhh! Now I see exactly what’s going on. Thank you for pasting that. This clears up the confusion.

Here’s the situation:

What’s happening

The PBTCCheckout component is a frontend React component, not an npm module you can import 'pbtc-payment-gateway' from.

The documentation shows the import as:

import { PBTCCheckout } from "@/components/pbtc-checkout";


That @/components/pbtc-checkout is inside the PBTC Pay project itself, not an npm package.

You installed pbtc-payment-gateway from npm, but it looks like that package doesn’t actually export a usable React component—it’s probably just the backend/server utilities.

What you should do
Option 1: Use PBTC Checkout as a standalone component

You need the frontend checkout component files. Usually, they live in the components folder in the PBTC Pay repo.

Steps:

Go to the PBTC Pay GitHub repo.

Find components/pbtc-checkout.jsx (or .tsx) file.

Copy that file into your CRA project, for example:

my-pbtc-app/
 └─ src/
     └─ components/
         └─ PBTCCheckout.jsx


Import it in your React app:

import PBTCCheckout from "./components/PBTCCheckout";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <PBTCCheckout
        amount={10}
        merchantWallet="YOUR_SOLANA_WALLET"
        reference="ORDER_1"
        onSuccess={(sig) => console.log("Paid!", sig)}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

Option 2: Use the backend API

If you just want to handle payments without copying components:

Spin up a backend server (Express.js) that uses the PBTC npm module.

React app calls your backend endpoints (/api/payments/create, etc.).

The backend talks to Solana and PBTC.

This is a bit more involved, but it’s the official way for production.

✅ Bottom line

The npm install pbtc-payment-gateway doesn’t give you a ready-to-import React component.

You need to either copy the frontend PBTCCheckout component from their repo OR set up a backend and call the API.

That’s why your CRA build fails—it can’t find a browser-ready PBTCCheckout in node_modules/pbtc-payment-gateway.

If you want, I can write a fully working React component for CRA using PBTC Pay that works without touching Node backend, ready to paste into App.js.

Do you want me to do that?

what in the fuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I get it—this is super frustrating. You expected a simple npm install and import PBTCCheckout to “just work,” but the package doesn’t include a ready-to-use React component. CRA is freaking out because it literally can’t find that module.

Think of it this way:

You did npm install pbtc-payment-gateway ✅

You tried import { PBTCCheckout } from 'pbtc-payment-gateway' ❌

CRA looks in node_modules/pbtc-payment-gateway for a file that exports PBTCCheckout—but it’s not there, because the package is mostly backend stuff.

That’s why webpack throws:

Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'pbtc-payment-gateway'


Here’s the fix without losing your mind:

Go to the PBTC Pay GitHub repo (or wherever the checkout component lives).

Copy the PBTCCheckout.jsx or .tsx file into your CRA project under src/components/.

Import it locally instead of from node_modules:

import PBTCCheckout from "./components/PBTCCheckout";


Then your CRA app can use it normally.

If you want, I can rewrite your App.js with a working PBTCCheckout integration that will compile in CRA right now, no backend needed. It’ll be copy-paste ready.

Do you want me to do that?
