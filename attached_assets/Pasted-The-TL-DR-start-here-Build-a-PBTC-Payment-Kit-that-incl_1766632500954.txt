The TL;DR (start here)

Build a PBTC Payment Kit that includes:

A reusable frontend component (React)

A tiny backend verification endpoint

A standard on-chain payment format

Docs + copy-paste examples

No custody. No KYC. No holding user funds.

Core Principle (important)

👉 You do NOT want to hold funds or act as a custodian.
That turns this into a regulated nightmare.

Instead:

User pays directly from their wallet

Merchant receives directly to their wallet

You just coordinate + verify

This keeps it:

Permissionless

Composable

Easy for the PBTC team to adopt

Architecture Overview
User Wallet (Phantom, Solflare)
        ↓
PBTC SPL Transfer
        ↓
Merchant Wallet
        ↓
On-chain confirmation
        ↓
Your verifier confirms payment

1️⃣ Use SPL Transfers (Do NOT reinvent payments)

Purple Bitcoin is an SPL token, so payments are just:

spl-token transfer


That’s it.

No smart contract needed for v1.

2️⃣ Payment Format (the magic sauce)

Define a standard payment payload that everyone uses.

Example:

{
  merchantWallet: "MERCHANT_SOL_ADDRESS",
  amount: 12.5, // PBTC
  reference: "ORDER_123456",
  memo: "PBTC Payment - Order 123456"
}


Why this matters:

reference lets you track payments

memo lets merchants reconcile orders

No backend trust required

3️⃣ Frontend Component (this is what gets adoption)

This is what the PBTC project owners actually want.

Example: <PBTCCheckout />
<PBTCCheckout
  amount={12.5}
  merchantWallet="MERCHANT_SOL_ADDRESS"
  reference="ORDER_123456"
  onSuccess={(sig) => console.log("Paid:", sig)}
/>


Behind the scenes it:

Detects wallet

Builds SPL transfer

Requests signature

Sends tx

Returns tx signature

Tools you’ll use

@solana/web3.js

@solana/spl-token

Wallet Adapter

Optional QR support

4️⃣ Backend Verifier (optional but recommended)

This is not custody — just confirmation.

What it does

Takes { reference, merchantWallet }

Looks up recent transactions

Confirms:

PBTC mint address ✅

Correct amount ✅

Correct recipient ✅

Reference/memo matches ✅

Minimal API
POST /verify-payment
{
  "reference": "ORDER_123456",
  "merchantWallet": "..."
}


Returns:

{
  "paid": true,
  "signature": "5x8...abc"
}


This lets:

Shopify-style apps

Game backends

Digital downloads
unlock content trustlessly

5️⃣ Make It a Drop-In Component (this is key)

If PBTC owners can add it in 5 minutes, they’ll use it.

You should ship:

✅ NPM package

✅ One React component

✅ One vanilla JS example

✅ One backend example (Node)

✅ One QR example (mobile)

6️⃣ Optional: Solana Pay Compatibility (smart move)

You can make it Solana Pay–compatible:

Generate payment URLs

QR codes for in-person payments

Mobile-friendly

That gives you:

Wallet support for free

POS use cases

No extra infra

7️⃣ What You Give PBTC Project Owners

You don’t pitch “a payment gateway”.

You pitch:

“PBTC Payments SDK — accept PBTC anywhere in minutes”

They get:

A reusable component

No legal risk

No custody

No smart contract risk

Easy ecosystem growth

8️⃣ What NOT to Do (early)

❌ Custom smart contracts
❌ Holding funds
❌ Auto-swaps
❌ Bridges
❌ “Bank-like” APIs

Those come later, if ever.
